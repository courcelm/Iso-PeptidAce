=============

Iso-PeptidAce is a stand alone software for the deconvolution of peptide isomers. It can be used for the quantification of mixed precursors, commonly found in mass spectrometry data sets. The user interface for Iso-PeptidAce is built using .Net 4. It is compatible with 64 bit versions of Windows 7 (and up). To work with Thermo instruments, MsFileReader (64 bit version) must be installed first.
