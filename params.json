{"name":"Iso-PeptidAce","tagline":"Stand alone software for the in silico separation of co-eluting peptide isomers in high resolution mass spectrometry data.","body":"Iso-PeptidAce\r\n=============\r\n\r\nIso-PeptidAce is a stand alone software for the in silico separation of co-eluting peptide isomers in high resolution mass spectrometry data. Peptide isomers of interest need to be synthesized and processed individually in a high resolution mass spectrometer, with dynamic exclusion turned off. Samples with unknown proportions of co-eluting peptide isomers processed in the same instrument, with a similar method will be separated by the software. Iso-PeptidAce can also quantify co-eluting peptides from mixed samples.\r\n\r\nThe user interface for Iso-PeptidAce is built using .Net 4. It is compatible with 64 bit versions of Windows 7 (and up). To work with Thermo instruments, MsFileReader (64 bit version) must be installed first. Iso-PeptidAce uses ProteoWizard (included) to process MS files.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
